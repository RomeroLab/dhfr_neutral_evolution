## Sequence files

* Gen15\_nts.aln.gz are 121654 sequences with filtering done on nucleotides
* Gen15\_aa.aln.gz are 121654 translated sequences from above. 
* Gen15\_aa\_extra.aln.gz are 127110 sequences where sequences with ambiguous nucleotides can still be translated to a unique amino acid. This sequence set with extra sequences is not used in the modeling process as we need a clean nucleotide sequence set.
